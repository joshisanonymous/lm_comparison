% Introduction
  % Variationist work has traditionally focused on a handful of bellweather variables and generalized out from there.
    % This is the case despite the more holistic approaches from work in dialectology that came before.
    % Variationist work in CMC has allowed for many more variables to be included at a time, moving back towards a holistic approach.
    % The objective for this study is to develop a method for comparing the languages of communities holistically, including practically all possible variables.
  % Variationist work that makes generalizes to communities from small sets of variables
    % Which group distinctions have been drawn
    % What are the advantages of this approach
    % What is assumptions remain that call for more holistic analyses
  % Variationist work in CMC that brings in many more variables
    % CMC definition and characteristics
    % Which group distinctions have been drawn
    % What sort of variables are used
    % This is holistic, but is it holistic enough?
  % An even more holistic approach is to use character n-gram and word n-gram language models
    % This has been used in classifiers in NLP for the task of language variety identification
    % The success of these models in distinguishing between even minorly different language varieties suggests that they can be compared to quantify the linguistic distance between two varieties, as well
      % Language models in NLP are, after all, essentially just probability distributions over some set of symbols
  % Research question
    % Are n-gram language models useful for quantifying the linguistic distance between communities?
% Methods
  % Data collection
    % Twitter data
      % Characteristics of Twitter
      % What makes this appropriate for this study
    % Tweet collected from Louisiana and filtered for discussion of race and ethnicity
      % Narrowing the type of data analyzed helps ensure that distinctions between communities won't be the result of simply different topics of conversation
      % The race/ethnicity situation in Louisiana has been analyzed before and is complex, so narrowing in this way may provide insights into social questions, though that's not the primary objective of this study
