% Introduction
  % Variationist work has traditionally focused on a handful of bellweather variables and generalized out from there.
    % This is the case despite the more holistic approaches from work in dialectology that came before.
    % Variationist work in CMC has allowed for many more variables to be included at a time, moving back towards a holistic approach.
    % The objective for this study is to develop a method for comparing the languages of communities holistically, including practically all possible variables.
  % Variationist work that makes generalizations to communities from small sets of variables
    % Which group distinctions have been drawn
    % What assumptions remain that call for more holistic analyses
      % At least implicitly, the assumption is that a small number of variables are representative of entire varieties
        % Of course, explicit commentary by community members or perceptual studies may suggest that these small sets of variables are in fact the most salient, but that does not mean that they alone tell us how close or far apart two varieties are
          % In fact, it's been suggested that saliency is a prerequisite before a linguistic variable can have social meaning (Podesva 2011:235)
          % Bell (1984) claimed that most linguistic variables are markers (Labov 1972) (152), but that is not necessarily still the case
          % Stereotypes (Labov 1972) and variables that have obtained 3rd order indexicality (Silverstein 2003) have been proposed, each roughly referring to variables that are salient enough to receive overt commentary, so the notion that variables can be this salient is widely accepted
          % The process of enregisterment of Pittsburghese has been examined largely in terms of the growing salience of variables (Johnstone et al. 2006)
          % [Possibly] give examples of where a small number of salient variables has been useful
            % Differentiating between "smooth operators", "alley saunterers", and "cosmopolitans" in China (Zhang 2005)
          % Indices have sometimes been used to determine saliency (Podesva 2011:237), but explicit commentary and perceptual studies are perhaps the best way, and latter have indeed become common in recent times
            % These studies often take experimental approaches, instead of the traditional observational variationist studies, using eye-tracking (D'Onofrio 2015), matched-guise experiments (Campbell-Kibler 2009; Delforge 2012)
            % Preconceptions of Valley Girls and Californians can impact perceptions of the TRAP vowel (D'Onofrio 2015)
            % The alveolar (ing) variant has been shown to be judged differently depending on the listener, but there was always a judgement (Campbell-Kibler 2009)
            % Vowel devoicing in Andean Spanish has been shown to be less noticeable by listeners when they do not want to notice it, as those who denied having the feature still had it at similar rates to those from elsewhere in whom they regularly perceived the feature (Delforge 2012)
          % The point is that saliency is indeed important when one is interested in social meaning
    % If interested in saliency, being able to compare the distance between varieties holistically with the differences in the use of a few salient variables may still be enlightening, though, and is not currently done
  % Variationist work that has involved looking for clusters of variables or large numbers of variables
    % Clusters
      % AAVE studies may focus on a small number of variables, but sometimes look at large numbers of features
        % Small number of variables
          % Zero copula, habitual be, plural -s, 3rd person present -s, and possessive -s in a speaker from the Bay Area (Rickford & McNair-Knox 1994)
          % Zero copula, (ing), (t/d) deletion, (r), word-final cluster reduction, and prosody in MLK Jr.'s speech (Wolfram et al. 2016)
        % The dialect density measure (DDM), developed in research on speech pathology and education, involves counting the frequency of features and has been employed in the study of variation in AAE using 32 different features (Van Hofwegen & Wolfram 2010)
        % Similarly, a set of 25 AAVE features as used by gay British men on Twitter have been analyzed according to frequency (Ilbury 2020)
        % Also on Twitter, 30+ non-standard spellings thought to be associated with AAVE have been analyzed in order to draw AAVE dialect maps in the US (Jones 2015)
      % Studies that look at systems
        % Vowel systems or at least good chunks of vowel systems
          % This has been done since the foundational variationist work in NYC (Labov 1966) and has continued in studies of other areas such as Belfast (Milroy 1980), King of Prussia (Payne 1980), Sydney (Horvath & Sankoff 1987), the Detroit area (Eckert 2000), Philadelphia (Eckert & Labov 2017)
        % Other systems
          % A large amount of the pronoun system of Louisiana French speakers in Houma (Rottet 1995)
          % Parts of the verbal morphology system and copula system in Cajun English (Dubois & Horvath 2003)
        % The covariation of several variables in Brazilian Portuguese in Rio de Janeiro has been examined to corroborate the existence of distinctive sociolects (Guy 2013)
          % This approaches the idea of drawing comparisons between varieties, but that was not really the goal, hence only four linguistic variables were studied as those were socially stratified (Guy 2013:64-65)
    % Variationist work that brings in many more variables
      % Technological advances have made processing large amounts of data much easier and so has made analyzing many variables at once much easier
        % There is more access to data
          % Not only have corpora created through sociolinguistic interviews been collected since at least the 1960s, large swaths of existing written language have been digitized (e.g., Google Books, BNC, COCA, Brown)
          % Data mining social media has made collecting large contemporary corpora more the question of what's ethical much more prominent than the question of how to obtain data (see D'Arcy & Young 2012 for some focused discussion)
            % Corpora for Twitter, for instance, have reached sizes such as 62 million tweets (Hong et al. 2011:519) or 114 million tweets (Eisenstein 2013:13) or even 924 million tweets (Huang et al. 2016:244)
        % The field of natural language processing (NLP) has led to the development of better and better tools, some that are particularly useful for expediting variationist analyse
          % Part-of-speech tagging is another tool that is now widely available
            % This typically involves training a tagger on some documents that were hand-coded for part-of-speech
            % Luckily, there are numerous corpora that are already hand-coded that can be used at least for major languages, such as the Brown corpus for English (KucÌ†era & Francis 1967)
          % Related to part-of-speech tagging is the task of parsing sentences
            % This is done in much the same way as part-of-speech tagging where some training data is used to train a parser that can then automatically parse new sentences
            % Again, luckily, there are already many corpora that have already been parsed by hand, referred to as treebanks, such as the Penn Treebank for English (Prasad et al. 2019)
            % These tools are useful for variationists looking at syntax but also potentially any other variationist whose linguistic variables may be syntactically conditioned
          % Classifiers are trained to accomplish a number of tasks that are useful for coding documents
            % "Documents" are understood in this case to be any amount of text that acts like a unit, be it a tweet or a book
            % A classic example of a classifier task is identifying the topic of a document
              % The goal is often solving problems such as spotting email spam (Dada et al. 2019), news topic classification, opinion mining, and so on (Minaee et al. 2021)
            % One classification task that is relevant here: language variety identification
              % The goal is to identify the variety used in a document when those varieties are relatively similar
              % This has been worked on for Arabic varieties (Bouamor et al. 2019), Balkan languages, Indonesian vs Malaysian, Portuguese varieties, Spanish varieties, French varieties, and Persian vs Dari (Zampieri et al. 2017)
          % These tools help variationists relegate much work that used to be done by hand to a machine
            % Admittedly, it is still prudent to go through samples of the data for quality assurance, but doing so is much quicker than coding by hand
            % Perhaps the biggest yet simplest advancement, particularly when considering how many variables can be analyzed at once, has just been counting
              % A few lines of basic code can return counts for tokens of linguistic variables from millions to even billions of words of text
      % Variationist studies that have looked at large numbers of linguistic variables at once
        % Somewhat between the a very large number of linguistic variables and the more traditional number of variables is Grieve's work
          % For example, Grieve et al. (2018) looked at 54 lexical items on Twitter that they judged to be innovations and mapped their geographic diffusion over time
        % Huang et al. (2016) looked at 211 sets of lexical items to examine regional variation throughout the US as expressed on Twitter
        % Pavalanathan & Eisenstein (2015) looked at over 200 lexical variables, treating them as binary options of either being present or absent, to examine the influence of audience on language use on Twitter
        % Bamman et al. (2014) looked at 10,000 lexical items in their analysis of gender on Twitter, though they used these items a bit differently from how they would be used in a traditional variationist study
          % The lexical items were first used to train a classifier to identify the gender of Twitter users
          % They then looked at which words were most strongly associated with one gender or the other, which is where the analysis more resembles traditional studies
          % Their methods are not unlike those that will be proposed here in that they also include a marriage of NLP and sociolinguistics
        % In some ways, these studies harken back to the early days of dialectology where the goal was to produce Atlases that demonstrated the boundaries between regional varieties such as the Atlas linguistique de la France for French (GilliÃ©ron & Edmond 1902) or the Sprach-Atlas for German (Wenker 1881/2020)
          % New technologies give modern work the opportunities for insights that were not possible in the past
          % A similar leap in research possibilities based on technological advancement that has been noted is the availability of tape recorders, which made socioilnguistic research based on real speech starting in the 1960s a reality (Milroy & Milroy 1985:52)
      % This is fairly holistic, but is it holistic enough?
        % A lot of these studies are really only looking at lexical variation even though they include many variables
        % A more holistic approach would include more than individual lexical items, even if very many individual lexical items are considered
          % How are other linguistic levels captured?
  % An even more holistic approach is to use character n-gram and word n-gram language models
    % n-gram language models take every unique n number of consecutive symbols in a corpus and counts up how often they occur
      % The symbols typically used are words or characters, but any symbol can be used
        % Given a corpus tagged for part-of-speech, consecutive parts-of-speech may be used, for instance
        % Given a corpus fully transcribed into IPA, consecutive IPA symbols may be used
      % An example might be a word bigram model
        % For a sentence such as "this is a sentence", the word bigrams contained would be "this is", "is a", and "a sentence"
        % Alternatively, a character 4-gram of the same sentence would yield "this, "his ", "is i", "s is", " is ", and so on
    % n-gram language models have been used in classifiers in NLP for the task of language identification and language variety identification, as mentioned above
    % The success of these models in distinguishing between even minorly different language varieties suggests that they can be compared to quantify the linguistic distance between two varieties, as well
      % Language models in NLP are, after all, essentially just probability distributions over some set of symbols
  % Research question
    % Are n-gram language models useful for quantifying the linguistic distance between varieties in a more holistic way than has been previously possible?
% Methods
  % Data collection
    % The europarl corpus
      % This is a parallel corpus that can be used to set the baseline for what one should expect between what are generally viewed as completely different languages and between one variety at different times
        % For different languages: built models from the English and French documents
        % For one variety: built models from the first and second halves of the English documents
        % In effect, this data can be said to be coded for language and text section
    % [Twitter data will be left out for the QP1 version] Twitter data
      % Characteristics of Twitter
        % What makes this appropriate for this study
      % Tweets collected from Louisiana and filtered for discussion of race and ethnicity
        % Narrowing the type of data analyzed helps ensure that distinctions between communities won't be the result of simply different topics of conversation
        % The race/ethnicity situation in Louisiana has been analyzed before and is complex, so narrowing in this way may provide insights into social questions, though that's not the primary objective of this study
      % Coding
        % The goal here is to compare linguistic distance between communities
        % Community detection
          % Communities are conceptualized on structural grounds in that those who interact with the same people on a consistent basis are considered to form a community
            % In this case, a directed tweet counts as the sender interacting with the receiver
            % The number of directed tweets between two users counts as the amount of interaction
          % Blondel et al.'s community detection algorithm is used
        % Language models will be built for a handful of communities which contain substantial numbers of tweets about race/ethnicity
          % Race/ethnicity are chosen because Louisiana has a complex history in this regard
            % Historically was not divided by Black and White, instead having Black, Creole, and White, but has come to be Black=Creole vs White=Cajun today
          % Race/ethnicity tweets will be detected using a classifier trained on 1% of the total tweets collected (~40,000)
          % There is some subjectivity about what exactly constitutes discussion of race/ethnicity
            % Include some examples of tweets that are unarguably about race/ethnicity and some that are not
  % Language models
    % Following Duvenhage (2019) due to his success for DSL 17, both word and character n-grams were trained, unigrams and bigrams for the former, bigrams, 4-grams, and 6-grams for the latter.
      % These models each capture different levels of the language, so I conceptualize them as follows:
        % Word unigrams: lexicon
        % Word bigrams: syntax (or at least some small amount of syntax)
        % Character n-grams: orthography and morphology
  % Analysis
    % Two statistics are used: KL divergence and cosine similarity
      % Both of these show essentially the same thing (i.e., how similar/different two distributions are), but the former is easier to interpret and the latter makes comparisons between language pairs easier as values are always between -1 and 1
      % These are calculated for like-models (e.g., word unigram to word unigram, character 4-gram to character 4-gram, etc.)
        % This makes it possible to see how distant two varieties are on different linguistic levels
% Results
  % europarl baseline results
    % What are the KL divergence and cosine similarity values when comparing French and English?
      % What about when comparing different model types? (Look at combining all models and looking at models individually)
    % What are the KL divergence and cosine similarity values when comparing English-English comparisons and French-French comparisons?
      % What about when comparing different model types? (Look at combining all models and looking at models individually)
  % [After finishing the QP1 version of this,] do the same for the Twitter data between detected communities
% Discussion
  % This technique for comparing varieties holistically appears to work, but there are some limitations to consider and questions left unanswered
    % Are the language models used here the right models?
    % How big do corpora need to be in order for this technique to work?
    % How does this relate to traditional work that typically examines only a few linguistic variables but in great detail?
  % Are the models used truly the best language models that could be used here?
    % For instance, KL divergence here is calculated based on the empirical probabilities for each n-gram in each model (i.e., relative frequencies)
    % An alternative would be to use something like term frequency minus inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which is commonly used in NLP and is meant to give the greatest weight in a model to n-grams that are frequent in a small number of documents
      % Eisenstein (2014) took a similar approach when identifying terms of import for differentiating between dialects on Twitter (5)
    % If, however, the type of models used here are not optimal, the approach can still be just as easily applied to other types of language models, both existing and yet to be proposed types
  % Related to whether these are the best types of language models to use for this technique of comparing varieties is the question of how large the corpora that are used to generate the language models ought to be
    % The europarl corpora are quite large, which presumably means there would not be a great difference between something like an empirical probability and any other sort of calculated probability
    % There are, however, cases where a researcher might want to apply the technique when using much smaller corpora
    % There may very well be a threshold where different language model types are more or less useful depending on whether the corpora size is above or below the threshold
      % This is something that cannot be addressed in the present study, but would be worthwhile to examine in future work
  % As was discussed earlier, salient linguistic variables may be far more important than other variables
    % For instance, the technique used here might find two varieties differ in that one variety uses the preposition "for" where another uses "of" sometimes
      % It is not evident that such a small difference is noticeable at all, even subconsciously, by speakers of these varieties
    % If the differences found between two varieties are not salient on any level, does it actually make sense to speak of them as two separate varieties?
      % This question cannot be answered here, but it is at least a question that can now be examined by comparing the results from a holistic technique as used here to results for the same data from a more traditional, fine-grained analysis
